To fix this, ensure that you only access `this.state.data` after it has been set. You can achieve this in several ways:

1. **Conditional Rendering:** Check if `this.state.data` is null before trying to access its properties.  This prevents the error from occurring.

2. **Optional Chaining (?.)**  Use the optional chaining operator (?.) to safely access nested properties.  If any part of the chain is null or undefined, the expression short-circuits and returns undefined without throwing an error.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  // ... (constructor and componentDidMount remain the same) ...

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        {/*Conditional Rendering*/}
        {this.state.data ? (
          <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text>
        ) : (
          <Text>Loading...</Text>
        )}

        {/*Optional Chaining*/}
        <Text>{this.state.data?.someProperty}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
The solution file (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates both approaches.  Choosing between conditional rendering and optional chaining depends on your preference and the complexity of your data structure.
