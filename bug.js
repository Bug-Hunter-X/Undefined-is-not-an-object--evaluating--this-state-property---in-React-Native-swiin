This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized.  In React Native, this often manifests when the component is still mounting or rendering. For instance, accessing `this.state.someVariable` within the `render()` method before `this.state` has been properly set by the constructor or `setState()` will lead to this problem.  Another common cause is accessing props before they've been passed down from a parent component.

Example:
```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null // Initially null
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    //Fetch data here, otherwise data is null
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    //Error occurs here if data is accessed before it is fetched
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text>  {/*Potential error here*/}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
